Create two classes: Car and ElectricCar. ElectricCar does NOT inherit from Car class.
Here's constructor of Car class:
 def __init__(self,make,model,year,isElectric=False):
 Make condition to Car class that if isElectric==True or make=="Tesla", then
 make eCar instance of ElectricCar class with last parameter True.
 Otherwise also make eCar instance, but with last parameter False.

 Here's constructor of ElectricCar class:
 def __init__(self,make,model,year,isTesla=True):

 In ElectricCar class make condition that if isTesla==True, call method getTeslaInfo(True),
 otherwise call same method with(False).

 getTeslaInfo method prints either ..make..model..year is a Tesla car or
 ...make ..model.. year is an electric car, but not Tesla.



example output:

myCar = Car("Tesla","Model S", 2019)
myCar2 = Car("Electra","Type X", 2000,True)
myCar3 = Car("Ford","Focus",2000)
#Tesla Model S is indeed a Tesla.
#Electra Type X is an electric car, but not Tesla.
#Ford Focus 2000 is a normal car.
